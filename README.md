## Features (MVP v1.0.0)

## Why This Matters

Most wellness apps feel fluffy.
Psych Bot turns emotional noise into tactical clarity:

Every defeat = data.
Every pattern = power.
Every decision = a move on the board.

Directly aligned with Project Checkmate System.

## Architecture
**New commands**
- `/reframe <thought>` → detects likely cognitive distortions + suggests a healthier reframe
- `/export json|csv` → exports all check-ins and journal entries into local files
- Python CLI bot
- Modular command parser
- Local encrypted storage (Phase 2)
- Crisis keyword safeguarding
- Weekly performance scoring: “System Score”

Flow:
User Inputs → Cognitive Filters → Action Design → Journaling → Score Feedback → Improved Behavior
